# Data Analyst Salary Project 

 1. Created a tool that estimates data analyst salaries to help data analysts negotiate their income when they get a job
 2. Scraped over 1500 job descriptions from Glassdoor using python and Selenium
 3. Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel,
AWS, and R
 5. Optimized Linear, Random Forest Regressors, and Lasso using GridsearchCV to reach the best model
 6. Built a client-facing API using flask
