The Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, established in 1981, is the only self-governing graduate and professional school of nutrition in North America. Its mission is to improve the nutritional well-being of people worldwide through the creation of new knowledge; the application and dissemination of information to inform evidence-based policy making; and the education and training of future leaders in the field. This mission is fulfilled by bringing together experts from the areas of clinical nutrition, social and public policy, and biomedicine. Faculty at the school include biomedical scientists, economists, epidemiologists, nutritionists, physicians, political scientists and psychologists who focus on a myriad of issues with the common thread of nutrition and its role in fostering the growth and development of human populations.

Some of the important research conducted by the Friedman School has included participation in two separate, five-year nutrition projects in Ethiopia. The first, Empowering New Generations to Improve Nutrition and Economic Opportunities (ENGINE) from 2011-2016, aimed to strengthen nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive (agriculture, education, social protection) programs to improve the health and nutritional status of pregnant women and children up to age five in select regions of Ethiopia. The second project, Growth through Nutrition, continues with some of the same objectives of ENGINE but with more of an emphasis on operational research, and a new component dealing with Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH).

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever.
